# Pyanodons Electric Tiles

Adds electric tile variants for all Pyanodons tiles. Each electric tile variant is unlocked at the same tech as the base tile.

Also fixes the original electric tiles to have the same movement speed/vehicle properties as the corresponding tiles modified by Pynanodons and modifies the electric tiles tech to use the same science packs as concrete.

Use the [Tile Upgrade Planner Redux](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/tile-upgrade-planner-redux) to quickly update all existing tiles to their electric variants.
